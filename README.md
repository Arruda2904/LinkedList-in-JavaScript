# LinkedList-in-JavaScript
Just a simple Linked List in JavaScript
The class LinkedList has the following methods:
-insertFirst;
-insertLast;
-insertAt;
-getAt;
-removeAt;
-clearList;
-printListData;

-removeOdd: that's a special method,not an usual method for a linked list obviously, 
but I had to use this for some test.Basically it returns a new list without the odd numbers.
